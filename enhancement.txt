Schema Review for Reporting:

The current schema provides a solid foundation for a booking application. The tables are well-structured, and relationships are clear, which is beneficial for basic reporting.

Strengths for Reporting:

Clear Relationships: Tables like bookings, users, departments, rooms, and guests are well-linked, allowing for joins to retrieve comprehensive booking details, user information, and room assignments.
Essential Fields: Key fields like checkInDate, checkOutDate, status, createdAt, updatedAt, guestCount, roomNumber, and documentPath in bookings are valuable for various reports (e.g., occupancy rates, booking trends, document compliance).
Historical Status: rejectionHistory in bookings provides a basic audit trail for booking rejections.
Soft Deletion: The isDeleted flag in bookings is good for retaining data for reporting even if a booking is logically deleted.
Areas for Improvement for Advanced Reporting (Weekly and Custom Reports):

To support a robust reporting module for weekly and custom reports, I recommend the following enhancements:

1.  Comprehensive Audit Trail/Historical Data:
    Current: updatedAt and rejectionHistory provide limited historical context.
    Recommendation: Implement a dedicated audit_log table. This table would record all significant changes (inserts, updates, deletes) to critical entities like bookings, guests, rooms, and users. Each entry would include the entity ID, field changed, old value, new value, timestamp, and the user who made the change.
    Benefit: This would provide a complete, immutable history of all data modifications, enabling detailed "point-in-time" reporting, tracking of changes over time, and answering complex "who, what, when" questions for compliance and operational analysis.

2.  Reporting-Specific Tables (Data Marts/Aggregates):
    Current: Reports would directly query the operational tables.
    Recommendation: For frequently run or complex reports (e.g., weekly occupancy, revenue per room type, guest demographics), consider creating denormalized "data mart" tables or pre-aggregated summary tables. These tables would be populated via scheduled jobs (e.g., nightly ETL processes).
    Benefit: This significantly improves reporting performance by reducing the load on the primary transactional database, ensuring reports run quickly without impacting live application performance. Examples: daily_occupancy_summary, weekly_revenue_by_department.

3.  Enhanced User and Room Metadata:
    Current: Basic user and room details.
    Recommendation: Add more descriptive or analytical attributes to users and rooms tables if relevant for future reports.
    users: lastLoginDate, departmentJoinDate, userType (beyond role, if applicable).
    rooms: More detailed features (e.g., hasAC, bedType, capacity as separate columns instead of JSON if frequently queried), lastMaintenanceDate.
    Benefit: Enables richer segmentation and filtering in reports (e.g., "bookings by new users," "occupancy of AC rooms," "maintenance trends").

4.  Standardized Reporting Periods:
    Current: Dates are stored as timestamps.
    Recommendation: Consider adding derived columns or views that map timestamps to standard reporting periods (e.g., week_number, month_name, quarter).
    Benefit: Simplifies report queries and ensures consistent aggregation across different timeframes.

Conclusion:

The current schema is perfectly adequate for the application's transactional needs. However, for advanced weekly and custom reporting, especially those requiring historical analysis, performance optimization, or deeper insights, implementing an audit trail and potentially reporting-specific aggregate tables would be the most impactful next steps. These additions would provide the necessary data integrity and performance for robust administrative reporting without burdening the live system.
