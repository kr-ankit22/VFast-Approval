# Requirements Document: BITS Pilani Hostel Booking System - Production MVP Upgrade

## Introduction

This specification outlines the requirements for upgrading the existing BITS Pilani VFast Hostel Booking System to a production-ready MVP. The system currently handles 300-500 booking requests per month and serves multiple departments within BITS Pilani organization. The upgrade focuses on workflow stability, enhanced user experience, notification system, and basic analytics while preparing for future OAuth integration.

**CRITICAL DESIGN PRINCIPLE**: This upgrade must build upon and extend the existing codebase, maintaining complete consistency with:
- Current technology stack (React, TypeScript, Express, PostgreSQL, Drizzle ORM)
- Existing component architecture and design patterns
- Current UI/UX theme using shadcn/ui and Tailwind CSS
- Established file structure and naming conventions
- Existing database schema and API patterns
- Current authentication and authorization patterns

The end result must be a cohesive system that appears as a natural evolution of the existing application, not a separate implementation. All new components must integrate seamlessly with existing ones, following the same coding standards, design language, and architectural patterns already established.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Workflow Stability & Edge Case Handling

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the booking workflow to handle concurrent actions and edge cases gracefully, so that data integrity is maintained and users have a reliable experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple users attempt to approve/reject the same booking simultaneously THEN the system SHALL prevent concurrent modifications and show appropriate error messages
2. WHEN a student attempts to resubmit a booking that is currently being reviewed THEN the system SHALL prevent the resubmission and notify the user
3. WHEN a booking is in PENDING_RECONSIDERATION state AND an approver tries to take action THEN the system SHALL only allow the student to resubmit first
4. WHEN a workflow lock expires (10 minutes) THEN the system SHALL automatically release the lock and allow other users to take action
5. WHEN a user navigates away during an approval process THEN the system SHALL release the workflow lock within 30 seconds
6. WHEN a booking state transition is invalid THEN the system SHALL reject the action and log the attempt for audit purposes

### Requirement 2: Enhanced Booking Details Modal

**User Story:** As an approver (Department HOD/Admin), I want to view comprehensive booking details in a well-organized modal, so that I can make informed approval decisions efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I click on a booking THEN the system SHALL open a modal using existing Dialog components with tabbed interface showing Overview, Journey, History, and Actions

5. WHEN viewing the Actions tab AND I have approval permissions THEN the system SHALL provide approve/reject buttons using existing Button components and form patterns
6. WHEN I approve/reject a booking THEN the system SHALL update the status using existing API patterns, send notifications, and close the modal
7. WHEN the modal is open THEN the system SHALL maintain existing responsive design patterns and work properly on different screen sizes
8. WHEN I reject a booking THEN the system SHALL require a reason using existing Textarea and validation patterns from current forms

### Requirement 3: Email Notification System

**User Story:** As a stakeholder in the booking process, I want to receive email notifications for relevant booking events, so that I can take timely action and stay informed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new booking is submitted THEN the system SHALL send email notification to the relevant department approver
2. WHEN a booking is approved by department THEN the system SHALL send email notification to admin approvers
3. WHEN a booking is rejected THEN the system SHALL send email notification to the booking creator with rejection reason
4. WHEN a booking is reconsidered THEN the system SHALL send email notification to the relevant approver
5. WHEN a booking is finally approved THEN the system SHALL send email notification to VFast team for room allocation
6. WHEN a room is allocated THEN the system SHALL send confirmation email to the booking creator
7. WHEN email sending fails THEN the system SHALL log the error and continue processing without blocking the workflow
8. WHEN configuring email templates THEN the system SHALL support HTML formatting and dynamic content insertion

### Requirement 4: In-App Notification System

**User Story:** As a user of the system, I want to see in-app notifications for booking-related events, so that I can stay updated without relying solely on email.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I log into the system THEN the system SHALL display unread notifications in a notification bell icon
2. WHEN I have pending actions THEN the system SHALL show notification count badge on the bell icon
3. WHEN I click on notifications THEN the system SHALL show a dropdown with recent notifications and mark them as read
4. WHEN a booking status changes THEN the system SHALL create an in-app notification for relevant users
5. WHEN I click on a notification THEN the system SHALL navigate me to the relevant booking or page
6. WHEN notifications are older than 30 days THEN the system SHALL automatically archive them
7. WHEN I have no notifications THEN the system SHALL show an appropriate empty state message

### Requirement 5: Basic Analytics & Reports

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to view basic analytics and reports about booking patterns and workflow performance, so that I can make data-driven decisions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access the analytics dashboard THEN the system SHALL display key metrics: total bookings, approval rates, average processing time, and pending requests
2. WHEN viewing department performance THEN the system SHALL show approval times and volumes by department
3. WHEN viewing booking trends THEN the system SHALL display monthly booking volumes and seasonal patterns
4. WHEN viewing workflow efficiency THEN the system SHALL show average time spent in each approval stage
5. WHEN generating reports THEN the system SHALL allow filtering by date range, department, and status
6. WHEN exporting data THEN the system SHALL provide CSV export functionality for further analysis
7. WHEN viewing real-time metrics THEN the system SHALL update dashboard data every 5 minutes

### Requirement 6: OAuth Integration Preparation
